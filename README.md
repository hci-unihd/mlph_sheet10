## Machine Learning and Physics, Sheet 10 

### Setup
For this sheet we set up a new conda environment, that includes ffmpeg and celluloid.
Alternatively, install these packages in the environment of the last sheet, or upload the notebook to google colabe (then you can even use the GPU for training)

Clone this repo and navigate into it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hci-unihd/mlph_sheet10.git
cd mlph_sheet10
```
Install and activate the conda environment:
```bash
conda env create --file=environment.yml
conda activate mlph4
```
Then you can start jupyter (run `jupyter notebook`) and open sheet10.ipynb, 
which you should use as the basis for the solution of the practical excercises.


### Hand in
 Hand in both your jupyter notebook, and an exported pdf (File -> Download as -> pdf). 
 If you encounter problems exporting the pdf like this, please print your notebook to pdf and hand this in.
